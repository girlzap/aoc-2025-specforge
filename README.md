# 🎄 Advent of Code with Spec-Driven Development (Python)

This repo contains my solutions to **Advent of Code**, but with a twist:
I’m using **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** to break down each puzzle into a clear, structured specification *before* writing any code.

This approach helps me:

* deeply understand each problem
* avoid logical mistakes
* generate clean test cases
* write simpler, more deliberate solutions
* separate *thinking* from *coding*
* learn about spec driven development in a fun way!

I’m also using my custom GPT, **SpecForge**, which converts raw puzzle descriptions into a consistent, readable spec format.

## 🧱 What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development is a workflow where you:

1. **Start with requirements** (e.g., the Advent of Code puzzle text).
2. **Turn them into a formal spec**, including:

   * problem summary
   * domain entities
   * inputs + constraints
   * expected outputs
   * rules & logic
   * edge cases
   * sample tests
   * solution outline
   * flow walkthrough
   * implementation plan
3. **Write code only after the spec is complete.**

It’s like a lightweight, human-readable version of TDD or BDD.

## 🐍 Why Python?

I love Python, and even though I don’t get to use it much at work, it’s perfect for:

* fast problem solving
* working with strings and numbers
* clear logic
* experimenting with algorithms
* Advent of Code’s quick iterations

Each solution here is deliberately simple, readable, and based directly on the spec produced by SpecForge.

## 📁 Repo Structure

```
.
├── day1/
│   ├── day1-input.txt     # Puzzle input
│   ├── part1.py           # Python solution
│   └── part1-spec.md      # Spec
├── README.md              # This file
└── ...
```

Each day will normally include:

* the puzzle input
* the Python script implementing the solution
* a spec (generated by SpecForge)

---

## 🧠 Using SpecForge

I start every puzzle by giving SpecForge a simple description like:

> “Here are my requirements…”

SpecForge then outputs a full spec with test cases and a solution outline.
I implement the code in Python based on that.

This helps me practice:

* problem decomposition
* algorithmic thinking
* clean design
* deliberate coding
* using AI in a structured, non-cheaty way

## 🚀 Running a Solution

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```bash
python day1/day1.py
```

Make sure the input file (`day1-input.txt`) is in the same folder as the script.

## 🎁 Goals

* Complete Advent of Code using solid engineering techniques
* Build up a reusable workflow for approaching puzzles
* Practice Python
* Reduce burnout and decision-fatigue by relying on clear specs
* Have fun solving things again ✨
